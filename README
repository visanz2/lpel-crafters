Bootstrap
=========

To generate the configure script and related build-tools, run

  ./build-aux/bootstrap

You are required to have fairly recent versions of the GNU buildtools
(autoconf, automake, libtool) installed.




Building
========

If you want to use libpcl context switching (suggested),
you need to install

libpcl - GNU Portable Coroutine Library, currently v1.12

available at

http://www.xmailserver.org/libpcl.html


If you cannot do a system-wide install, you need to specify the
installation directory of pcl for the configure script.


Run configure with following parameters:

./configure --with-pcl=<pcl_install_dir> --prefix=<your_lpel_install_dir>

and

make
make install

In order to build the LPEL backend for the S-Net runtime system,
you'll need to specify the directories where to find the LPEL library and
includes.

./configure --with-lpel-includes=<lpel_include_dir> \
            --with-lpel-libs=<lpel_lib_dir>

/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/



Example
-------

I have installed pcl in the local subdirectory of my home directory.
To build LPEL, I use

./configure --with-pcl=$HOME/local/ --prefix=$HOME/local/
make
make install
