\defgroup OCR_FIFO_Hub FIFO Hub
The Resource Hub, has the following properties, see also the section \ref OCR_Hub.
L1_FIFO is a data structure representing a L1_FIFO buffer, which is a specific instantiation of a L1_Hub.

  - State:
    - const L1_UINT16: Size // number of fixed size data blocks in FIFO
    - L1_UINT16: Count
    - L1_List: Buffer

  - Synchronisation Predicate upon L1_EnqueueFIFO:
    - Predicate: Count < Size
    - Action: Count := Count + 1, retrieve Data from Packet, and insert Data at end of List/Buffer

  - Synchronisation Predicate upon L1_DequeueFIFO:
    - Predicate: ount <> 0
    - Action: Count := Count â€“ 1, retrieve Data from (first element) of List/Buffer and exchange with Packet, rerun L1_EnqueueFIFO I any waiting Task in the Put Waiting List

  - Invariant(s):
    - both waiting lists are empty, or only one waiting list contains waiting requests, i.e.
      - length (put waiting list) <> 0 implies length (get waiting list) = 0
      - length (get waiting list) <> 0 implies length (put waiting list) = 0
    - content of waiting lists are dependent on the current state, i.e.
      - Count <> 0 implies length (get waiting list) = 0
      - length (Put waiting list) <> 0 implies Count == Size
      - Count <> Size implies length (put waiting list) = 0

\section OCR_FIFO_Hub_Example Example
This example illustrates the use of the FIFO Hub. Task1 puts a character into a packet and sends this to FIFO1. Task2 initially waits for 2 seconds for the FIFO to fill up and then retrieves the packets from FIFO1 and displays their content.
\subsection OCR_FIFO_Hub_Example_Entities Entities
  - FIFO1: The FIFO bugger between Task1 and Task2, it can store 5 elements.
  - Task1: Task1EntryPoint, shown in section \ref OCR_FIFO_Hub_Example_Task1
  - Task1: Task2EntryPoint, shown in section \ref OCR_FIFO_Hub_Example_Task2
  - StdioHostServer1: A Stdio Host Server component which provides acess to the console.
  - StdioHostServer1Res: A Resource Hub to ensure that a second task does not interfere with console access.
